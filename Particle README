The basic command line for the program is this:

Basic properties file:
======================

MovementType = the type of movement the particles will have
Number = the number of particles generated
Coordonates = the coordonates for each type of movement
RedColor = red color intensity (0-255)
GreenColor = green color intensity (0-255)
BlueColor = blue color intensity (0-255)
Lifetime = the distance a particle will travel before it is destroyed
Speed = the speed of the particles
Size = the size of the particles
ColorEffect = the color effect
SpeedEffect = the speed effect
Filter = special filter for some particle movements
Delay = the delay before the particle starts (seconds)
Duration = the duration of the particle (seconds)
Texture = the texture of the particle


Color transition:
-NULL for no color transition
-"random" for random color transition

Speed effect:
-NULL for no effect
-"accel" for acceleration
-"decel" for deceleration

Filter is for point_r and point_rd (ripple effect and ripple effect with reversion) = the size of the line

Types of movement: point, point_r, point_rd, liniar, random, random_rain, random_blk, mouse

Texture = add any .png image to create a texture

Important
=========
Because of the opengl buffer, the program can't have both simple particles and textured particles at the same time.
