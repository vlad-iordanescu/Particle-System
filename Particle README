The basic command line for the program is this:

For point movement:
===================

./Particle (type of point movement) (number of particles) (start point x coord) (start point y coord) (color red) (color green) (color blue) (lifetime) (speed) (size) (color transition and next color) (speed effect) (length if necessary)

Ex.

./Particle point 1000 10 10 255 255 255 100 0.5 0.1 NULL NULL
./Particle point_r 1000 25 25 0 0 0 1000 0.3 0.2 colortrans 255 255 255 accel 10

Color transition:

-NULL for no color transition
-"random" for random color transition
-"colortrans" and 3 numbers for specific color transition

Speed effect:
-"accel" for acceleration
-"decel" for deceleration

Length is for point_r and point_rd (ripple effect and ripple effect with reversion)

Types of movement: point, point_r, point_rd

For liniar movement:
====================

./Particle liniar (type of point movement) (number of particles) (first x coord) (first y coord) (second x coord)...etc (color red) (color green) (color blue) (lifetime) (speed) (size) (color transition and next color) (speed effect)

You can assign an indefinite number of coordonates for a specific trajectory.
The rest is like in the point movement

For global movement:
====================
./Particle liniar (type of point movement) (number of particles) (first x coord) (first y coord) (second x coord) (second y coord) (color red) (color green) (color blue) (lifetime) (speed) (size) (color transition and next color) (speed effect)

The coordonates are to point that are diagonal opposed corners for a rectangle
The first coordonates are the lower point.

Types of movement: random, random_blk, random_rain
